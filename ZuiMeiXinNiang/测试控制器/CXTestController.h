《爱恨的潮汐》是一部在晋江文学城连载的近代现代小说，作者是祈凛。
 爱恨的潮汐。往来交替。三个人。两段情。他说他爱他,她说她爱他。谁会爱谁?谁在想谁?谁会伤谁?一曲缠倦的爱恨悲歌.一段你侬我侬的悲欢离合。 谁的梦里都有谁。谁的梦缠上谁的罪?
 
 《一本凑字数的书，怎么就成了永恒的经典》，；：…；
 
 有人说话磨磨唧唧，有人写作拖泥带水。
 
 从前我把这种情况归纳为：啰嗦和繁冗。当我读了《麦田里的守望者》，里面有一句话叫做“大卫.科波尔式废话”，把上述情况作了全新的定义。
 
 
 The 1966 New York City smog (November 23–26) was an air-pollution event, with damaging levels of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, smoke, and haze. Coming during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, it was the third major smog in New York City, after a similar event in 1953 (pictured) and another in 1963. Leaders of local and state governments announced an alert and asked residents and industry to take voluntary steps to minimize emissions. Health officials advised people with respiratory or heart conditions to stay indoors. The alert ended after a cold front dispersed the smog. It was an environmental disaster with severe public health effects, including 168 deaths, according to a statistical analysis. The smog catalyzed greater national awareness of air pollution as a serious health problem, and became a political issue. With support from presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, a series of bills and amendments aimed at regulating air pollution culminated in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act.
